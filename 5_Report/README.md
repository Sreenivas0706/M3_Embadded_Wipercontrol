A wiper generally consists of a metal arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used in some vehicles. The blade is swing back and forth over the glass, pushing water or other precipitation from ts surface. The speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds and often one or more intermittent settings. Most automobiles use two synchronized radial type amms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more photographs arms.
